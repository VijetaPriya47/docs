- User access logs
- Request paths through system

### 7. Model Tests ⚠️ PARTIAL

I tested model deployment. Some parts work, some need more setup:

| Feature | Status | What Happened |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Model Definitions | ✅ PASS | Model types work |
| Sample Models | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Models ready but need controller |
| Model Routing | ✅ PASS | Traffic to models works |

## Security Check

### How Authentication Works ✅
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant G as KGateway
    participant A as Auth Service
    participant M as ML Model
    
    U->>G: Request + JWT
    G->>A: Check Token
    A->>G: User Info
    G->>M: Safe Request
    M->>U: Model Response
```
